***
## Setup
1. Go to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new app.
2. Remember the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`\
2a. Open settings and add `http://localhost:5000/` to the redircet_uri whitelist
> You can optionally edit `app.patch` to change the scopes, note that doing this can break somethings.
> > You shouldn't mess with the patches unless you understand JS (`app.patch`) and HTML (`index.patch`) 
3. `./setup.sh`
---

# Musl
Those on musl won't be able to run `./setup` as it requires nodejs to be installed, which isn't yet compatible with musl libc...\
But Spotbash can still be used from musl, the user just has to create `$HOME/.cache/spotbash/authkeys`\
```
$ cat authkeys
REKEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLSEC=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
The client ID and secret can be found in set 1 of [Setup](#Setup)\
While REKEY is a bit harder to get... And requires a browser and server to make a request to Spotifys API\
Spotify then returns the Auth key, and a Refresh key, the Refresh key is used to request new Auth keys since the expire 1 hour after being created\
I'll make a server where this can be done, for now you can use [SquidtifyJS](https://github.com/ThatGeekyWeeb/SquidtifyJS/) with the JS console
## Usage
1. `./spotbash help`
