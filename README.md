#### TODO
- [ ] Add play `artist` suport
- [ ] Add `album` search support

:x: Add *any* modify support
> Modify support seems to need to be done server side, support for it is currently on hold.
***
## Setup
1. Go to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new app.
2. Remember the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`\
2a. Open settings and add `http://localhost:5000/` to the redircet_uri whitelist
> Optionally edit `app.patch` to change the scopes, currently all non-follow scopes are used.
3. `./setup.sh`
## Usage
1. `./spotbash help`
```

Spotbash is a "Control API" which means it only controls the Spotify placyback of devices. The nodejs server can be used as a standalone player;

See below.
***
I recommend using `Spotify Web Playback SDK` as a device, as it only requires a spotify compatible browser.  

Addtionally a Web Playback SDK implementaion is embedded into `app.js`, and can be used after running `setup.sh`

Note that `setup.sh` disowns a `node` process, meaning a `node` process will continue to run in the background until it is killed

Closing the Browser Tab will not kill this process!\
If you have any issues trying to use the Web Playback SDK implementaion please open a issue!
> Please do not open any issues regarding authorization failure, this is most likely due to the lifetime of an oauth key being only 1 hour long.
