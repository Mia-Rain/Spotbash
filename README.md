#### TODO
- [ ] Add play `artist` suport
- [ ] Add `album` search support

:x: Add *any* modify support
> Modify support seems to need to be done server side, support for it is currently on hold.
***
## Setup
1. Go to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new app.
2. Remember the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`\
2a. Open settings and add `http://localhost:5000/` to the redircet_uri whitelist
> Optionally edit `app.patch` to change the scopes, currently all non-follow scopes are used.
3. `bash ./setup.sh`
## Usage
1. `bash ./spotbash help`
```

***
Spotbash is a "Control API" which means it only controls the Spotify placyback of devices. It cannot be used as a standalone player!
***
Some usable devices are `librespot`, `Spotify Web Playback SDK`, `Spotifyd`, or any device with a Spotify app. 
***
I recommend using `Spotify Web Playback SDK` as a device, as it only requires a spotify compatible browser.\
Addtionally a Web Playback SDK device is embed into `app.js`, and can be used after running `setup.sh`
