### Pull Requests
The development of Spotbash has ended indefinitely, but if anything is missing, or you might want to see, open a PR, I'll review it and merge it!
> ***

#### Things that are missing
Several things are missing from Spotbash, here are a few;\
Follow support (Users cannot Follow playlists, albums or artists using Spotbash)\
> Heart/Like support (No ability to like tracks or add them to a certain playlist is implemented)

Playlist editing/creation (Playlists can only be played from)\
Modify support (The ability to modify playlists, is currently on supported)
> There are many more things that could/should be implemented, but this is simply a control API and was only meant to be a proof of concept, as well as a response to a joke a friend made.

Spotbash is a "Control API" which means it only controls the Spotify playback of devices. The nodejs server can be used as a standalone player;

See below.

I recommend using `Spotify Web Playback SDK` as a device, as it only requires a Spotify compatible browser.  

Additionally, a Web Playback SDK implementation is embedded into `app.js`, and can be used after running `setup.sh`

Note that `setup.sh` disowns a `node` process, meaning a `node` process will continue to run in the background until it is killed

Closing the Browser Tab will not kill this process!\
If you have any issues trying to use the Web Playback SDK implementation please open an issue!
> Please do not open any issues regarding authorization failure, this is most likely due to the lifetime of an OAuth key being only 1 hour long.
